              <p>The journey you have taken in yoga class often generates some momentum and you have been supported by your teacher and fellow students in your practice. However, at this stage, it may feel that your practice is still fairly new and you may not feel confident or ready to “go it alone.”</p>
              <p>This feeling is entirely normal and understandable, and it is also an opportunity to truly make the practice your own and integrate yoga more fully into your life!</p>
              <p>Please use the class offerings below as a guide as you continue your journey.  Class times may change, so please call the center or go to the website before attending. Thank you for sharing your time, energy, and life with your teacher! Namaste.</p>

                <li>Arrive ten minutes before class begins to give yourself time to sign in and find a spot from which you can see and hear.</li>
                <li>In most environments where yoga is practiced, it is customary to remove your shoes before entering the room.</li>
                <li>Refrain from eating too much right before class.</li>
                <li>Wear comfortable clothing – loose-fitting and/or stretchy is best.</li>
                <li>Most classes make use of a yoga mat. Sometimes mats can be borrowed on-site either for free or for a small fee. You can purchase your own mat at any department or athletics store.</li>

              <h2 class="c-section__heading">The Work-Study System</h2>
              <p>Many commercial yoga schools and studios do not offer free regular classes. Class fees can be prohibitive for many worthy students. Because of this, many studios offer work-study opportunities to the community. You can trade your time as a receptionist or cleaner for free classes. Specific arrangements will vary from business to business, but a typical commitment is 4 hours per week for unlimited free classes. If there's a studio near you that's out of your price range, call or write to the manager and ask about work-study.</p>
